# lazyload

This image lazyloader is designed to help you save http requests on images.

Most of the time, when you have 100 images on a page, your user doesn't need them all.

It's like http://davidwalsh.name/lazyload-plugin but standalone and faster to
show images at page load.

## How to use

Add lazyload.min.js to your page in the `<head>` section, either src or inline if
you do not have any other scripts in the `<head>`.

Change all `<img>` tags to lazyload :

```html
  <img
    data-src="real/image/src.jpg"
    src=data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==
    onload=lzld(this) />
```

### Why another lazyload plugin

We could not find any standalone lazyloader but [the one on stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3228521/stand-alone-lazy-loading-images-no-framework-based).

We first used this one, then we re-wrote it entirely with ideas from [mod_pagespeed lazyloader](http://www.modpagespeed.com/lazyload_images.html?ModPagespeed=on&ModPagespeedFilters=lazyload_images).

mod_pagespeed lazyloader fails on IE because it triggers an infinite onload loop. We solved that.

### Browser support

IE8+ or modern browser. IE6 & 7 does not support base64 images.

If you need IE6 & 7, use the b.gif image instead of the base64 src.

### How we do it

We built our lazyloader with efficiency and speed in mind.

We do not call `documents.getElementsByTagName` (not at start, not in a loop). Each image register itself to the
lazyloader. This was a great idea taken from mod_pagespeed.

Scroll and resize events are throttled so that we do not run too often.

Adding to the `<head>` is mandatory otherwise we could not show images as fast as we want.

I recommend adding the script in inline in the `<head>`. It only weights
< 500 bytes gzipped.

The base 64 src should be the smallest possible it is from http://probablyprogramming.com/2009/03/15/the-tiniest-gif-ever

Do not worry about the size overhead of adding a lot of base 64 src images to your page :
 GZIP is here to help (http://www.gzip.org/deflate.html).
